# The City

The Perfect City is a dream/nightmare world mostly devoid of people
where Seba is trapped after his girlfriend gets kidnapped.
The City appears to have its own will, but readily responds to Seba's mental state -
his mind and the City are one thing. The origin of the City is uncertain and mysterious.
Some characters including Seba have god-like abilities, yet are not omnipotent.
I think therefore I am? Or maybe I think because I am? What am I? Where am I?
I think because there's the City, the nightmare that won't let me wake up.
If you can't wake up that nightmare might as well be your reality...

## 1. Core elements of the City

### 1.1 Maze

All buildings look familiar, roads lead to nowhere, it's easy to get lost.
The city wants you to lose your way home, your belongings and soul.

### 1.2 Empty, lonely

The City is uncannily empty, looks like people left few moments ago but never returned.
With people gone the City keeps living like a corpse walking. There are few people in
the City, most of them insane, unfamiliar or disappear in moments you need them most.
Long dead, insane, imagined, these are the citizens of the Perfect City.

### 1.3 Dream-like

The teapot talks! The walls listen! Is the world fucked up or am I fucked up?
You can almost grab the moon, it's so close! You never know if you're awake or dreaming.

### 1.4 Insane

Seba's mind melts, the insanity of the City grows on him. I closed the doors, did I?
I left the doors here, but they're gone. There's only the key left in the concrete wall.
Wait, the doors were in my pocket this entire time! Silly me. The key melts.

### 1.5 Stalks you

There are no people but you feel watched. The items move, looking askance at you.
Something moved in the other room. Was this street light here last time?
The city plays around with you, it sees your moves and acts to get you lost.

### 1.6 Dark

With barely any color, the world is gray. The TV noise pours into your eyes and drains your brain.
You think you're over, your previous life lost, you're thinking about ending it all.
It's high up there, the cold wind is blowing in your face and even after all your tears dried up the rain still fills your eyes.

### 1.7 Mysterious

What's behind the corner? Where are the pipes leading to? Why am I trapped here?
Where's my girlfriend? Is there a god of this world?

### 1.8 Hostile

The City wants to steal your soul and eat your flesh. It's nothing personal, is it?
If this is hell, then the City's hostility is your punishment, but it's quite rough even for hell.

### 1.9 Strips your identity

As you stay in the City you lose a sense of self and start questioning your very existence.
The City wants to remake Seba in its own image.

### 1.10 Hope, Beauty

Even in all this madness Seba still loves the City because **it's where he belongs.**
Seba loves the smell of warm asphalt during rain, loves the walls of his ghetto.
Monsters chasing him won't make him give up on his friends. With or without his soul,
he still loves and cares.

## 2. Monsters

Monsters of the Perfect City are personifications of Seba's fears and traumas.

### 2.1 Tap monster

### 2.2 Drillman

### 2.3 TV monster

### 2.4 Potato seller

Buys children in exchange for a bag of potatoes.

### 2.5 Road sign monster

### 2.6 Konstal 105N
